# Campus Skill Exchange Platform

Campus Skill Exchange is a full-stack MERN web application where students can list skills, discover peer instructors, request learning sessions, schedule accepted sessions, track progress, mark sessions as completed, and give reviews and ratings.

The platform is designed to make peer-to-peer learning inside a campus more organized and accessible.

---

## Problem Statement

In colleges, many students have useful skills, but there is no structured system to find who can teach a particular skill. Students usually depend on WhatsApp groups or personal contacts, which makes skill discovery and session management difficult.

Campus Skill Exchange solves this by providing a centralized platform where students can offer skills, request sessions, schedule learning, track progress, and review instructors.

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mdyahiyaariz/campus-skill-exchange.git
cd campus-skill-exchange
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

---

## Backend Setup

Go to the backend folder:

```bash
cd backend
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file inside the `backend` folder.

You can refer to:

```txt
backend/.env.example
```

Add the following variables:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string_here
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
NODE_ENV=development
```

Start backend server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Backend runs on:

```txt
http://localhost:5000
```

---

## Frontend Setup

Open another terminal and go to the frontend folder:

```bash
cd frontend
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start frontend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs on:

```txt
http://localhost:5173
```

---

## Frontend and Backend Connection

The frontend connects to the backend using Axios.

File:

```txt
frontend/src/api/api.js
```

Example:

```js
import axios from "axios";

const API = axios.create({
  baseURL: "http://localhost:5000/api",
});

API.interceptors.request.use((req) => {
  const token = localStorage.getItem("token");

  if (token) {
    req.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
  }

  return req;
});

export default API;
```

For deployment, replace the local backend URL with your deployed backend URL.

---

## Environment Variables

The real `.env` file is not pushed to GitHub for security reasons.

Required backend variables:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string_here
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
NODE_ENV=development
```

GitHub should include:

```txt
backend/.env.example
```

GitHub should not include:

```txt
backend/.env
```
